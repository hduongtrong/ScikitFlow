Run Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Neural Network, Recurrent Neural
Network, Sequence to Sequence Model in the interfact of Scikit-Learn.

# Installation
No need for installation. Type
```
python seq2seq.py
```
to start training a Sequence to Sequence model. This model will map a sequence
of polynomial coefficient to a sequence of polynomial roots. Similarly for other
type of model, like Logistic Regression, or Vanilla Neural Network. It runs the
model on MNIST dataset by default.
